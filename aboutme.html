	<p>I'm Nitish Khadke and I am currently a Computer Science major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and originally from Singapore.
	In high school, I was part of the squash team, guitar orchestra, and often volunteered at local community events. 
	My hobbies include music and gaming.</p>
	
	<p>While at UIUC, I am interested in joining ACM SigBot (an ACM special interest group for robotics), The Illini Squash Club, and going on an ASB (Alternative Spring Break) Trip. I look forward to making new friends from all over the world at the University! </p>
