		<p>I'm Nitish Khadke and I am currently a Computer Science major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and originally from Singapore.
		In high school, I was part of the squash team, guitar orchestra, and often volunteered at local community events. 
		My hobbies include music and gaming.</p>
		
		<p>While at UIUC, I am interested in joining ACM, The Illini Squash Club and conducting research at the University. I look forward to making new friends from all over the world at the University! </p>
